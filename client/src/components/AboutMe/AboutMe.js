        <p>
          Hello! My name is Gina Im and I am a full-stack JS developer. I have
          an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a master's degree in civil
          and environmental engineering. I have conducted scientific research,
          worked as a structural field engineer, and, most recently, I have
          conducted workplace accident/fatality investigations for the feds. I
          have a full-stack developer certificate from the University of Denver
          and have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering examination for
          Environmental Engineering. Problem-solving and troubleshooting are
          second nature to me so naturally I was drawn to the tech industry. I
          love being immersed in solving a problem and building things!
